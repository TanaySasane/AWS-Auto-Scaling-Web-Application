# 🚀 AWS Auto Scaling Web Application

### 🌐 Highly Available • Scalable • Production-Ready Cloud Architecture

This project showcases the design and deployment of a **fault-tolerant and auto-scalable web application** on AWS using industry-standard cloud architecture patterns.

It simulates a **real-world production environment** capable of handling variable traffic loads while ensuring **high availability, performance, and security**.

---

## 📌 📖 Project Overview

Modern applications must handle unpredictable traffic while maintaining uptime.
This project solves that by implementing:

* 🔄 **Auto Scaling Infrastructure**
* ⚖️ **Load Balancing Across Instances**
* 🌍 **Multi-AZ High Availability**
* 🔐 **Secure Networking via VPC**

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 🔹 VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

* Custom CIDR block for isolation
* Public subnets for ALB
* Private subnets for EC2 instances
* Route tables and Internet Gateway configured

### 🔹 Application Load Balancer (ALB)

* Layer 7 load balancing (HTTP/HTTPS)
* Intelligent request routing
* Health checks to ensure only healthy instances serve traffic

### 🔹 Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

* Dynamic scaling based on demand
* Maintains minimum, desired, and maximum capacity
* Automatic instance replacement (self-healing)

### 🔹 EC2 Instances

* Deployed using Launch Template
* Pre-configured web server (e.g., Nginx/Node.js)

* 💸 Scales in during low usage to reduce cost
* ⚡ Improves response time with load balancing
* 📊 Ensures consistent performance under load

---

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

* 🔐 Security Groups for controlled access
* 🌐 Private subnets for backend instances
* 🚫 No direct public access to EC2
* 🔑 IAM roles for secure AWS service interaction

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

* 📈 AWS CloudWatch for metrics & alarms
* 📜 Logs for debugging and performance tracking
* 🚨 Alerts for unusual activity or failures

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* ☁️ AWS EC2
* ⚖️ AWS Application Load Balancer
* 📈 AWS Auto Scaling
* 🌐 AWS VPC
* 🔐 IAM & Security Groups
* 📊 AWS CloudWatch

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. Create a custom VPC with subnets
2. Configure Internet Gateway & routing
3. Launch EC2 instances / create Launch Template
4. Set up Application Load Balancer
5. Configure Target Group & Health Checks
6. Create Auto Scaling Group
7. Attach ALB to ASG
8. Test scaling with simulated traffic

## ??? Frontend Overview

The `frontend/index.html` file now delivers the dashboard that powers the user experience in this repo. It reads from `/instance` and renders thematic cards for hostname, scaling status, CPU utilization, RPS, latency, and desired capacity, plus:

* A Live Timeline of autoscaling signals that rotates every few seconds.
* AWS-focused highlight tiles covering Auto Scaling Group, ALB, VPC/networking, and monitoring.
* A control panel with a slider, notification banner, and theme picker (Night Mode, Sunset Glow, Light/Paper, and Simple Light).

## ?? Running Locally

1. `cd backend && npm install` (once) to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` so Express serves the `/instance`, `/health`, and the static frontend from `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Open the browser, click �Check Instance,� tweak the slider if desired, and switch themes to see the palettes.## 📷 Demo / Screenshots
